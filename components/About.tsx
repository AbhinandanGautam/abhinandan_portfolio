          Hello, I am Abhinandan Gautam. Currently I am working as SDE1 at
          Amazon India. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and
          Engineering from NIT Jalandhar with a CGPA of 8.73.
          <br></br>I love developing full-stack web applications and have built
          several web-related projects. Iâ€™m also skilled in problem-solving and
          data structures, with experience solving over 1800 problems on
          platforms like LeetCode and participating in numerous coding contests.
          <br></br>My internships include developing a full-stack placement
          website for my university and working on AWS services and backend
          development with Amazon India's International Machine Learning team.
          Additionally, I gained in-depth training in AI and machine learning at
          Accenture while working there for 3 months.
